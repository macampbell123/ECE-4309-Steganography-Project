The program provides a secure way to encrypt and decrypt user-entered text while ensuring privacy through input masking. As users type, their input is masked with 'X' to protect sensitive data. Basic editing is supported, allowing users to delete characters using the backspace key. The input text is then encrypted using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm, with a password-derived key for secure encryption. The encrypted result is encoded in Base64 to make it portable. AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode) is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm that offers data integrity and authenticated encryption, widely used in protocols like MACsec, ANSI Fibre Channel Security Protocols, and IEEE 1619 group for securing data-at-rest.
